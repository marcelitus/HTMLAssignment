 people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart
 and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."</h2>

        <p>This is a hard question, it all depends!. But in general terms, if you are just getting started the ideal would be to work for a few years at a Startup to get expierence and learn form peers.
        Once you have built some experience now it is time to jump into building your own company!
        Here is my favorite video about the subject:
